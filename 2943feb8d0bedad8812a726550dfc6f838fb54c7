v3:
- attributes has been properly incapsulated to qemu-timer (as suggested by Stefan Hajnoczi)
- attributes definition and docs refactored to avoid extra enum and use simple macros with explicit bit positions (as suggested by Stefan Hajnoczi and Paolo Bonzini)

v2:
- timer creation/initialize functions reworked and and their unnecessary variants removed (as Paolo Bonzini suggested)
- also their comments improved to avoid info duplication
