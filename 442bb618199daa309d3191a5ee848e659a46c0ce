Conversion and association between QEMUTimerAttrBit and accessor macro are dumb.
Maybe better alternatives exist (like QFlags in Qt framework) or existing qemu code may be reused, if any.
Attributes also may be better named as flags, but they looks like something volatile, whereas 'attribute' expresses constant nature better.
